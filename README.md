I think the todo is:
1. Properly configure the input to have labels, apply sanity checking, allow selection of units
2. Automatically populate fields based on the previous entry so people don't need to enter the same thing over and over
3. Make the saved shots readable
4. Reorder things, and make CSS not terrible
5. Add the keywords that will initially be used
6. make a simple function that attempts to guess what to do based on small subset of key words and input arguments
7. ...make the thing actually look good
8. Configure this so it's per bean type, eg, the front page will be a list of your beans, when you click one then it shows all the brews you made with that bean and the last config you used
9. focus on using it to actually see if it helps
